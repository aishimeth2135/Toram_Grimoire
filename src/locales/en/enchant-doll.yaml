    auto-find-negatives:
      title: Please set additional conditions for automatic selection.
      caption: You can set the doll to give priority to the highest success rate or the lower material consumption when automatically choosing. The set of negatives with the highest success rate and lowest material consumption may also be exactly the same.
      option-texts:
        success-rate: Success rate
        material: Material consumption
  stats-from-auto-not-enough:
    - Insufficient number of automatically selected negative stat, you may need to add negative stat by yourself.
    - When the number of negative stats are insufficient,stats filling doll may not be able to correctly calculate the set of negative stats with the highest success rate.
  auto-selected: Doll automatic selection

tips:
  no-stat-selected: You have not chosen any stats...
  stats-reached-upper-limit: 8 stats have been already selected...
  stat-repeated: Already have this stat 0.0
  at-least-one-positive: At least one positive stats.

  performance:
    auto-find-negatives: According to the selected stats,stats filling doll may need some calculations when automatically selecting negatives, And may cause the page to be freeze for a few seconds, which is normal.
    auto-find-original-potential-minimum: According to the selected stats, finding the lowest potential requirement may require a huge amount of calculation，And may cause the page to be freeze for a few seconds, which is normal.
    auto-find-original-potential-minimum-and-auto-find-negatives: When performing 「finding the lowest potential requirement」, stats filling doll will simplify the calculation process of finding the set of negatives with the highest success rate, so the accuracy may be reduced by 0.0
  cannot-auto-find-original-potential-minimum: Even if the potential exceeds 99, the success rate of this equipment is still not 100%, so the lowest potential requirement cannot be found. You can try other stats 0.0
  cannot-directly-modify-previous-step: You can’t modify the previous steps directly 0.0
  unknown-error-when-calc: Stats Filling doll don’t know why he got lost...Please contact the author.
